# Tile Editor, aka "TED"

Whilst reading [Doom Guy: Life in First Person](https://romero.com/shop/p/doomguy), John Romero mentioned that he coded a simple tile editor for the Keen series. I thought this would be a fun challenge, so started creating one for my [c/c++ game engine](https://github.com/joncarlmatthews/handmade) whilst sat in the departure lounge of Dublin airport.
